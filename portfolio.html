      <p>My name is Ebony Penson. Like Naruto, I'm a bit of an odd ball, have a tragic past and am determined to be different and prove everyone wrong. Believe it! I am an artist: I draw, mold things out of clay, fix toys, customize shoes, and play 4 instruments. I love to game and swim, and I like to cosplay. I have 2 cats and 2 fish tanks and my saying is "Go big or go home". </p>
